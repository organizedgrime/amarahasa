# Webscraped Amarahasa

This is not [Amarahasa](https://en.amarahasa.com/), but it is related.

I like using an e-reader and got annoyed that the website was not open source or available in other formats, so I made an [n8n](https://n8n.io) workflow to grab that data for me.

I've included the PDFs I'm reading from as well as the tools I used to create them, all under the same license used by Amarahasa itself.

I hope this makes the content more accessible for other readers as well.
